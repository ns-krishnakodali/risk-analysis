# Risk Analysis

This repository contains a basic machine learning project done as part of an ML course.  
It focuses on **Risk Analysis** of a stock portfolio using several methods:

- **Historical Simulation**
- **Parametric Method (Variance-Covariance)**
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**
- **Neural Network-based Prediction**

The primary goal is to compute and compare **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** using both statistical techniques and a neural network trained on historical return data.

## Files

- `var-cvar-risk-analysis-reformatted.ipynb`: Implements historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo approaches for traditional VaR and CVaR estimation.
- `nn-var-cvar-reformatted.ipynb`: Trains a neural network to predict returns and evaluates risk metrics based on its output.

## Note

This is a **very basic academic project** created purely for learning purposes as part of a Machine Learning course.
